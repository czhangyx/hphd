# Welcome to the Human-Pathogen Herpesvirus Database!

## Installation
We are assuming that you are using a Linux operating system (enabled Windows Subsystem) and already have an Apache server set up!

### Set APACHE_ROOT
In order for our bash scripts to work, you must set the APACHE_ROOT variable correctly as it is referenced in the scripts. In order to do this, 

```
#replace path with either `/var/www` or `/var/www/html` depending on where the directory is
export APACHE_ROOT='/path/to/rootdir'
```
